<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>

- I'm Paul (aka Plastic Bottleneck) from Germany.  
- I'm currently studying church music and I love playing the piano and pipe organ. I'm also interested in various scientific fields such as human anatomy (general biology), astronomy, meteorology, geology, radio physics, chemistry, and computer science!  
- I also take great pleasure in collecting computers and have gathered 38 of them over the years. My oldest one is the Sperry Univac from 1955. I'm fascinated by the 6502 processor and, as a result, own two C64's. I have a deep appreciation for Commodore as a company, which unfortunately went bankrupt back then. However, my server has been running IBM systems for years without any errors.  
- My collection of computers has allowed me to delve into various CPU architectures. As a result, I enjoy writing in 6502 and x86_64 assembler and C, which I particularly adore.
