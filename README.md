## Who is Paul?
Paul, alias Plastic Bottleneck is obviously me.  
I live in Germany such as my idol [the suckless guys](https://suckless.org/) team with their great and simple software which just "sucks less".  
I like playing instruments succh as the piano and the organ etc.. I also love working with computers from any age. Mostly before the 2000's. My oldest one is out from 1955 which is a ```SPERRY UNIVAC```. My newer ones are C64's, C128's, HP's, IBM's, etc.. I have 31 computers in total and got them all together over the years. I also love programming in C, x86_64 Assembly, 6502 Assembly, Altair 8800 binary, Microsoft basic (C64 etc...), Fortra, bash and python.

## Main Project - Plus-Linux 0.4.0

Plus Linux is based on Kernel 5.19.1 at a small size. 
It also uses busybox instead of GNU. I may make my own coreutils in C later to make it even smaller and with less bloat. 

*Plus Linux is really buggy because it's still in Alpha*

## What it offers:
1. Main:
    - Plus Linux is based on Kernel 5.19.1 (Will be updated soon)
    - It's using Busybox as the systemutils
    - With that it is complete GNU and Systemd free
2. Goals:
    - To fit on a single floppy drive (1.44Mb)
    - Having less bloat than other distros like U*untu
    - Trying to be stable (even though it isn't at the moment)
