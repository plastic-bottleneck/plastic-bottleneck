# Plastic Bottleneck

Hi, my name is Paul!
I'm a hoppy electrition and computer nerd.

I collect many computers and old technology over the years to use and love them.
My oldest one is from 1955 - A Sperry Univac.
I have two commodore c64's where I learned programming on for the first time. 
Today I use **C** and **x86_64 assembly**. 

I'm currently working on Plus Linux: https://github.com/plastic-bottleneck/Plus-Linux
