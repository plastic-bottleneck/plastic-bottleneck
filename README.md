Hi,
my name is Plastic Bottleneck!
I'm a student from Germany who enjoys working with computers and general
technology.

I'm interested in various scientific fields such as astronomy, meteorology, radio stuff 
and computer science!

I also love collecting computers and have gathered 49 of them
over the years. My oldest one in my collection is the Sperry Univac from 1955.
The MOS6502 got me into hardware-near programming back when I was little.

My collection of computers has allowed me to delve into various CPU architectures.
As a result I've been programming in C, 6502 and x86 assembly in my freetime!

I currently use as my main systems OpenBSD and plan9front.
The 9front grid I run is made out of one file server, one authentication server
and 16 cpu servers.
Linux has been less of an option for me since Kernel 6 has released.
Personally, I've got so much more out of my computers when I switched to using 9front
and OpenBSD!

At the moment I'm thinking of implementing a blog to my site since I've been
working on a lot of projects at the moment.

You can reach out to me 24/7 on irc.libera.chat! My nick is plbn.

So that's it! Have a good day.
Sincearly

Plastic Bottleneck
