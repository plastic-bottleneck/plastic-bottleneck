## //About me:

Hi, 
my name is Paul, the maintainer of this webpage.
I'm a student from Germany who enjoys working with computers and general 
technology, especially from the era before the 2000s.

I'm currently studying church music and I love playing the piano and pipe organ. 
I'm also interested in various scientific fields such as human anatomy 
(general biology), astronomy, meteorology, geology, radio physics, chemistry, 
and computer science!

I also take great pleasure in collecting computers and have gathered 38 of them 
over the years. My oldest one is the Sperry Univac from 1955. 
I'm fascinated by the 6502 processor and, as a result, own two C64's. 
I have a deep appreciation for Commodore as a company, which unfortunately went 
bankrupt back then. However, my server has been running IBM systems 
for years without any errors.

My collection of computers has allowed me to delve into 
various CPU architectures. 
As a result, I enjoy writing in 6502 assembler, some Risc-V, 
x86_64 assembly, ARM, and C, which I particularly adore.

### )( PUTILS

> PUTILS will be the coreutils for Plus Linux when they are finished.
> Currently it has some basic functions like ls, etc.
> It also includes [ED2](https://github.com/plastic-bottleneck/ed2) which I wrote from scratch in C for it to have a tiny text editor inspired by the best editor in the world - ed.

#### Here are the current utils which are available and planned: 

|util|what it does|how to use|available|
|---|---|---|---|
|ls|lists files|`ls [-l] [/path/to/file]`|ðŸŸ¢|
|cat|write out a file|`cat [file]`|ðŸ”´|
|rm|remove a file/directory|`rm [file/directory]`|ðŸ”´|
|cp|copy a file/directory|`cp [file/directory]`|ðŸ”´|
|ed2|edit files with ed2|`ed [file]`|ðŸŸ¢|
|mkdir|make directories|`mkdir [dir name]`|ðŸ”´|
|mv|move a file/directory|`mv [file/directory] [/path/to/place]`|ðŸ”´|
|pbsh|shell|-|ðŸŸ¢|
