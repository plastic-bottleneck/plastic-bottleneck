    PLASTIC-BOTTLENECK(1)         User Manual         PLASTIC-BOTTLENECK(1)

NAME
       Plastic Bottleneck — Plan9 and OpenBSD enjoyer B)

SYNOPSIS
       Hi, my name is Plastic Bottleneck! I’m a student from Germany
       working with computers and other technology stuff!

DESCRIPTION
       I am interested in various scientific fields, including astronomy, 
       meteorology, radio operations, and computer science.

       Collecting computers has been a hobby of mine for as long as I can 
       remember. To date, I’ve collected around 49 of them!

       The oldest one in my collection is the Sperry Univac (1955).

       When I was young, I got my first Commodore C64 from a friend. Programming 
       on it was a lot of fun! 
       Sadly, a bad power supply bricked it.
       The MOS6502 fascinated me because it can run basically anything! 
       That’s how I got into programming a bit of 6502 assembly back then. 
       Now, I primarily program in C — which I LOVE! I've also done some HDA
       and other chipprograming!

       My main operating systems in daily use: OpenBSD and 9front
       The 9front grid consists of:
       -> 1 file server
       -> 1 authentication server
       -> 16 CPU servers

       I primarily use OpenBSD and 9front over Linux because of the stability 
       and the super clean codebase they provide.

       Radios fascinate me too! I have built multiple antennas for different 
       purposes, such as receiving NOAA weather satellite images or QSOs from 
       around the world at night.

       One day, I want to complete my ham radio exam and go live like the other 
       cool operators!

       Another hobby I love is playing the piano and church organ. 
       I’ve been doing this for nearly 14 years now.
       I also collect instruments.
       In total I've got one grand piano, one upright piano, 3 harpsicords
       and 5 organs!

       So that’s it! Have a good day.
